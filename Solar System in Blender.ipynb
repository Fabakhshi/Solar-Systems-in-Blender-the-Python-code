The second function is called Scale, which I have not used. Because the scale determines the size and smallness of the planets, and if it was used, the planets would become very small compared to the sun and could not be seen. The third function is Movement, which determines the movement of the planets. The total output is inside the x_out variable, which depends on three inputs: frame number, planet number, and location. After loops are defined for all planets and frames to be able to do the animation in total.\n",

    "After the Python code, I downloaded the textures based on the given site and set them on the objects. To set, you first select the object and refer to the material properties and create a new material using this section. For general lighting, I downloaded an HDRI photo and went to the world properties section and set the color to the environment texture, and opened the downloaded photo in this section. Regarding the overall lighting of the scene, no light was used and only the same HDRI photos were used, which have a high dynamic range and the range of their color numbers is more than one, so they are very suitable for the lighting of the scene.\n",

    "Perhaps it would be better to talk a little more specifically about sunlight. For this purpose I used a spherical point light, I put it instead of the sun but slightly bigger than it so that it can make the planets that rotate towards it brighter than behind them. Of course, it should be noted that the emission given to the material of the sun was a little luminous, but it was not able to illuminate the environment. Therefore, it had to be given light to make the space brighter.\n",
